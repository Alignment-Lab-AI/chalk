CHALK_OPT_DOC = """
# Chalking basics
Chalk marks are, by default, stored as JSON in benign part of artifacts.  That makes them easy to find when needed.

 The JSON will always appear on a single line, and will start with: `{"MAGIC" : "dadfedabbadabbed",`.  That makes it easy to extract marks in binaries with:
```bash
strings mybinary | grep dadfedabbadabbed
```

The mark always is JSON, but might be embedded differently depending on the file type. For instance, in Unix scripts (i.e., starting with `#!`), it will generally be embedded in a comment starting with '#'.

## What to Chalk
Generally, you can put any metadata you want in the chalk mark. Most metadata we collect will be small, though SBOMs and SAST tool results could be large.  You can go minimal, and only put in identifying information, and then send the rest of the metadata you're interested in from the build environment somewhere else.  The identifying info will get reported, AND go into the mark, so you can easily tie things together.

Some of the identifiers of note:

- `CHALK_ID` is unique per code artifact, calculated whenever possible from the hash of the UNCHALKED artifact.  That hash will generally be available as `ARTIFACT_HASH`.
- `METADATA_HASH` is essentially a hash of the metadata that actually got inserted into the chalk mark.

- `METADATA_ID` is a more readable version derived from the metadata hash value.

If you do not want to add chalk marks directly to an artifact, you don't have to.  The chalk mark still gets produced.  With binaries configured via this Wizard, they currently will get dropped in a file named *virtual.json*.

However, we recommend only using these for dry runs, as keeping track of the marks becomes far more error prone.

"""

OUT_DOC = """
# Output Reporting

These reports are always run after Chalk is invoked. If artifacts have been marked, key data from the chalk mark will get reported, potentially along with other info that wasn't put into the mark.  You can select what goes into reports and what goes into the chalk marks later in the wizard.

## Note
There are things you cannot do through this Wizard, such as having each output configuration get different data sent to it.

This Wizard is only designed to handle the most common cases.  If you need more flexibility, you should consider writing a configuration file directly, instead of generating one.

For documentation on that, please see our web page.

4. The additional MIME header is strictly optional.  It may be necessary for authentication.

For the additional MIME header, If you need the value to be dynamic, or need more than one header, then you'll have to manually edit your configuration file.  You can always put in a placeholder, generate the con4m output file from the Export menu, and then only edit that one piece of it.

DOCKER_LABEL_DOC = """# Docker Auto-Labeling

The metadata Chalk reports on can be automatically added to docker labels to your image when you run *'chalk docker build ...'*

The OCI standard for labels requires them to start with reverse-DNS entries.  The value you provide will be added to the label name, with a suffix consisting of a value derived from the metadata key, adhering to OSI name standards.

For instance, by default, the label for the Chalk ID would be:
```
run.crashoverride.chalk-id
```

If your container build uses Docker features unsupported by chalk, the labels will *NOT* get added.  Chalk falls back on running docker as-is, without reporting, if it cannot completely comprehend the semantics of the build.

Specifically, Chalk currently doesn't yet support remote build contexts.

This wizard currently allows you to setup and manage chalk configurations.  The wizard covers the most common functionality, but if you want more customization, you can manually create a configuration.  See the documentation.
