# Note that there are already two pre-built output configurations.
# They are both subscribed to the 'stderr' sink.  You can remove those
# subscriptions.
#
# - "log_hook",   to which chalk log messages post. There are filters
#                 installed to add optional color, and to filter based
#                 on your log-level setting.
#
# - "con4m_hook", to which errors in the configuration file post. The
#                 same filters are installed; it respects the same
#                 'log-level' setting, but all messages posted to it
#                 will be 'error' messages.
#
# You can, if you like, configure subscriptions to the underlying
# topics, in order to hook up other sinks.  The logging topic is
# called, appropriately enough, "logs".  The topic for configuration
# file errors is "con4m".
