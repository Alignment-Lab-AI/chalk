%{H Usage: {appName} defaults }%
Shows the results of evaluating the configuration, without actually doing any work with artifacts.

Even though they are related, there is a huge difference between the 'defaults' command and the --defaults flag.  They both dump the configuration after evaluating any config file, but they may easily produce different results.

That's because chalk uses {bold}con4m{reset} for configuration, which, while typically just looking like a regular config file, can have arbitrary code added, with conditionals, and so-on.  The default configuration does, for instance, configure different output handlers, depending on the command given.

Running {bold}{appName} defaults{reset} will therefore give you the information about the evaluation when you run the 'defaults' command.  Whereas, {bold}{appName} --publish-defaults extract{reset} will dump the config as it resolves when you run the 'extract' command, which could be very similar, or very different.

However, note that running {bold}{appName} --publish-defaults extract{reset} still runs the 'extract' command.

This command does not show the contents of the config file(s) used, just key results from executing those config files.  And, generally there will be at least two 'stacked' configuration files.  See {bold}{appName} help config{reset} for more information on the configuration file and con4m.
