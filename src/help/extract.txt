%{H Usage: {appName} extract [COMMAND_OPTION]... [search path] }%
Extracts metadata into artifacts specified in the search path.

Extract metadata is then 'published' to the 'extract' topic.

%{T:<14:
Variable::Override::Type::Description
recursive::-r, -R, --recursive, --no-recursive::bool::Determines whether a file scan will recursively walk paths.
}%

 In the absense of any output configuration, data will be published in JSON format, but pretty-printed (somewhat), to stdout.  See 'help output' for an overview of the outputting system, which includes filters.

Also, unless configured otherwise, the 'extract' command will report a list of artifacts it found in the search, where an insertion would have been configured to insert, but there was nothing to extract.
