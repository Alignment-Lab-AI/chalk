%{H Usage: {appName} delete [COMMAND_OPTION]... [search path] }%
Deletes metadata from all artifacts specified in the search path.

Without configuration overrides, deleted objects will be 'published' to the 'extract' topic before deletion. 

Note that there is currently no flag for specifying exceptions, so we recommend running this on specific artifacts.
