%{H Usage: {appName} insert [COMMAND_OPTION]... [search path] }%
Inserts metadata into artifacts specified in the search path.

There are two styles of marking, one where all metadata is directly attached to the artifact, and one where the artifact is marked primarily with a 'pointer', and then the rest of the metadata is stored elsewhere.  Generally, we recommend writing a 'pointer' by default.

It is easy to choose which keys in the full set of possible metadata get put either into a pointer, and it's easy to select which metadata isn't collected at all.  Similarly, it's easy to write full metadata to multiple different places, and include different keys in each place.  See {bold}{appName} help output{reset} for details.
